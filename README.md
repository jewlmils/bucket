# Bucket

This project involves organizing tasks into categories. Categories contain various tasks, each with its own name, description, status, and the number of tasks within it. Tasks are defined by their name, description, status, and the category they belong to. Additionally, it incorporates User Authentication using the devise gem.

For instance, consider a category named "Event Planning," with the description "Tasks related to organizing the upcoming event." Within this category, tasks such as "Book venue" might be listed, accompanied by a description like "Ensure the venue can accommodate 100 guests comfortably." Task statuses can be either "Pending", "Priority", or "Completed."
